- How props helps components to be more resuable
- I made a aribnb experience clone with props concept like how to pass props in component
  and receive the props in components 
- The datatype of props when the component receives it is an object!
- The Map() array method convert and array of raw data into array of JSX elements that can be displayed on the page 
- Map () method is better than creating components manually like it makes our code more self-sustaining.
